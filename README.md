# D_DNameGenerator
This is repurposed version of an insult generator.  This was a test to see if I could salvage code from another project.  This project 
takes names that have been collected from an assortment of places including the player handbooks for DnD and are put together based
on the pronunciation of the names.  This comes from the palyer handbooks on how the names are supposed to work together.

# Finished Project
This project was finished two years ago.  This was before I had any real programming experience and was my first time every touching java. 
This project was a spin off of another one that was an insult generator for me and my friends.  However, I wanted to see if I could deploy
something to Google Play.

Below is the link to my app on the store

Honestly, I am very surprised by this, but my application has over a thousand installs.  I didn't keep up with updates since I was still in
college and actually had started working professionally during that time.

Now if anyone wants to reuse this code and publish a new app using this code as the base go ahead.  Thanks for stopping at this repo.
